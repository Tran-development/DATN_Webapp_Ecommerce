This is my graduation project

The topic "Building An Ecommerce Web Application Optimized By AI" is a promising combination of two increasingly developing fields: e-commerce and artificial intelligence. During the research and implementation of this project, I will learn AI methods and technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision to optimize the WebApp eCommerce system.
